The Smart Water Drink Monitor is an electronic device that uses an Arduino microcontroller, a camera, and facial recognition technology to monitor a person's daily water intake. The camera captures an image of the user's face and uses facial recognition algorithms to identify the individual. Once the user is identified, the device keeps track of their daily water intake by tracking the quantity of water they drink. The information is then stored and can be accessed to track the user's progress over time and ensure they are staying hydrated. The device provides an easy and convenient way to monitor water intake and helps to promote healthy hydration habits.
